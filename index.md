# Welcome to [Chibli, Genet and Imperiale. Stability analysis of a new curl-based full field reconstruction method in 2D isotropic nearly-incompressible elasticity. Submitted.]'s demos!

Demos can be browsed statically but also interactively—to start a session and run the code just click on the rocket icon at the top of a tutorial page and then click on "Binder".
You can also launch a JupyterLab session with all tutorials: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mgenet/Curl-Based-Reconstruction-Paper-Demos/master?urlpath=lab/tree/./demos).
